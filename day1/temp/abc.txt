Cheetah with three heads? Three sides, three heads. At least a picture depicts that! What's the problem? Is this cheetah merely a photograph? Or it actually exists. In actuality, it's the expertise of a knowledgeable wildlife photographer.

We are going to show you that wonderful picture of a cheetah that was captured by a wildlife photographer. This picture will win your heart.

Wildlife photographer captures rare photo of cheetahs

Is it normal to take the photo in a way that makes the cheetah appear to have three heads? While Paul patiently waited, Akore immediately pressed the camera's shutter button. He is making headlines everywhere for this.  

At a speed of 100 km/h, the cheetah moves quickly. He personifies speed. The images of that moving creature have everyone in awe. It's a photograph. 

Paul Goldstein, a wildlife photographer from Wimbledon, captured this gorgeous image. In Kenya's Masai Mara National Park, the photo was taken. Paul posted the image to his Facebook page. He also mentions that photographing such moments is a fascinating experience.

The photo took a total of 6 hours 
How much time did he need? He took the photo over the course of six hours. Paul was able to capture this image of these three cheetahs while he was standing in the pouring rain. The cheetah is descending. Nearly all cheetahs have disappeared. Similar scene in Africa. They admit that it is not at night, but rather during the day. Unexpectedly, they are unable to climb trees.

Sharing it on Facebook, he wrote, "Moments like these are mesmerizing. And yes, it was seven hours' worth in the rain." At the time of writing, Paul's post had 2000 likes and 153 shares. Along with this, people also praised his picture a lot. Many people are saying this after seeing this picture.

Cheetahs are becoming extinct

This animal has become extinct in more or less every country in Asia, including India. However, once again, the process of reintroducing the cheetah has started in India. 

Eight cheetahs will be brought to India from Namibia, which PM Narendra Modi will release at Kuno-Palpur National Park (KPNP) on his birthday, September 17. These eight cheetahs will be brought from Namibia in Africa to Jaipur in Rajasthan on September 17 and will be sent from there to MP.

It is not hard to notice that Paul's image shares a striking resemblance to the State Emblem of India. Instead of lions, the photo features cheetahs.


The original State Emblem, an adaptation of Ashoka's Sarnath Lion Capital, depicts four lions standing back to back on an abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a bell-shaped lotus.
